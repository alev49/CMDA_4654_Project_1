### Data Introduction

Our data comprises of two data sets. One data set is from the Index of Economic freedom, (https://www.heritage.org/index/pages/all-country-scores) site that scores the economic freedom of different countries based on particular metrics such as property rights, tax burden, labor freedom ,etc and will calculate an overall score to show how 'free' a countries economic opportunities and such are. The scores are from 0-100 where 100 means the country is the most 'free' in that area of analysis while 0 means no freedom for that particular category. The next data set that we have is the internet usage by country data set found here (https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/internet-users-by-country). It consists of 3 main variables the total internet users per country, internet traffic in Terabytes and the percentage of internet users in the country. We have combined both of these data sets into one larger data set to do our analysis which we will talk about in the abstract section. 

Here is a link to our two data sets https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12HrlXJR_UdA65qzBq8JsycShSF3KdxXM?usp=sharing

### Abstract 

We have a few goals we intend to reach in analyzing this data set. First one being we are interested to find any relationship between particular Economic Freedom parameters that could help predict not only the percentage of internet users for a country as well as what that relationship looks like. We also intend on finding a way to classify a countries region based on particular Economic Freedom Indexes and their respective internet user percentage and see what relationships or differences different regions of the world would have with those parameters. We will use a multitude of classification algorithms from kNN to Naive Bayes and use two multivariate regression models and see the pros and cons of each respective model in our results tab. 

Below we have two plots showing Percentage of Internet users and Ecnonomic Freedom Score and we can already see some patterns between these two variables. We will of course need ot do more analysis to fully flesh out the relationships the two data parameters may have.

mapCountryData(worldMap, nameColumnToPlot ="Overall_Score", mapTitle="Overall Economic Freedom Score")
```


Multivariate Regression {data-orientation=columns}
=====================


```{r, include=FALSE}
parameters <- c("", "Government_Spending", "Business_Freedom", "Monetary_Freedom", "Investment_Freedom", "")
fullModel <- lm(cbind(Percent_People_Connected, Overall_Score) ~Government_Spending+Business_Freedom+Monetary_Freedom+Investment_Freedom, data = cleaned_data)

values <- fullModel$coefficients
newdata <- data.frame(Tax_Burden =50, Government_Spending=50, Business_Freedom=50, Monetary_Freedom=50, Investment_Freedom=50, Financial_Freedom=50)


```

### Parameter Values
```{r}
knitr::kable(fullModel$coefficients, col.names = c("Percent People Connected","Overall Score"))
```



### Description
For Multivariate regression we decided we wanted to see if we can predict the percent of people that are connected to the internet along with the country's overall economic freedom score based on the country's Government spending, business freedom score, monetary freedom score and investment freedom score. The reasoning behind this was just the interest in finding if there was any relation between all of these parameters.

We also plotted the the specific relationship between our predictors and response variable. We noticed that business freedom correlated highest with percent of people connected to the internet. We also found (unsurprisingly) many of the economic freedom index scores were correlated with the overall economic score except for government spending. We are not sure why that is.

Ridge Regression {data-orientation=rows}
=====================

### Description
We'll use Percent People Connected as the response variable and the Financial Freedom, Government Spending, Government Integrity as predictors. To perform ridge regression, we use glmnet function to fit the ridge regression with alpha = 0 and find the best lambda. Then we can calculate the R squared pf the model on the training data, the R squared of the model is 43.68%, the best model was able to explain only 43.68% of the variation in the response values of the training data.The goodness of fit of the model is relatively low, these three predictors are not good enough to predict the Percent People Connect of a country.

LOESS Fit {data-orientation=rows}
=====================
### Description
We are using the LOESS to fit a curve to the relationship between variables in pair, Financial Freedom and Percent People Connected, Government Spending and Percent People Connected, Tax Burden and Percent People Connected, Property Rights and Percent People Connected. We can see that only Financial Freedom and Property Rights have a clearly positive relationship with Percent People Connected. This is consistent with the expectation that people of a country have more financial freedom and property rights have more possibility to access to the Internet.

Description {data-navmenu="KNN Classification" data-orientation=columns}
=====================


### Description
For K-Nearest Neighbors Classification we decided to try and figure out based on Overall Economic Freedom Score and percentage of internet users how you can classify what region that country belongs to. We already have our data classified based on region and some of the regions are larger than others making this knn classification more biased to those countries. We wish to see if the possible relationships that arise in trying to classify the region, like would certain regions would cluster in certain areas like say, higher Monetary Freedom Score index and high internet connection percentage. 

In our testing we decided the other parameter besides percent of people connected to the internet to classify regions with would be the Monetary Freedom Score. For whatever reason this gives our highest accuracy score of 0.5510204 without adding any more variables to be classified with. One possible explanation could be that when compared with percentage of people connected to the internet, the Monetary Freedom Score has the least looking correlation as seen in our multivariate regression tab. 

The plot shows the section that the training set created when it was being trained on with 70% of the whole data set as its training set. Each colored section represents the region's region for classification. So for example Sub-Saharran Africa has a large region that is mainly clustered with a low percentage of people connected to the internet but a fairly high range of monetary score while Europe region has a very small region of high percentage of people connected ot the internet in comparison.

Logistic Regression Classification {data-orientation=rows}
=====================

### Description
Since the data did not contain a data type that is required by Logistic regression, we have to create some new variables. We defined the threshold for Percent People Connected and Tax burden by using mean(), then create a two new variables to record the result. The new created variables are Connected and Heavy. Connected = 1 means the percent of people of this country is greater than the mean value, Connected = 0 means the percent of people of this country is smaller than the mean value. Heavy = Heavy(= 1) means the tax burden of this country is greater than the mean value, Heavy = Not Heavy(= 0) means the tax burden of this country is smaller than the mean value. After we set up the new variables, then we can do the Logistic regression. We used Financial Freedom and Property Rights as predictors and we found that the country have heavy tax burden have more percent people connected to the internet in general. And we also can get two prediction formula to predict, logit(Ì‚ Ï€) = -2.03 + 0.059 Financial Freedom âˆ’ 1.37 Not Heavy, logit(Ì‚ Ï€) = -1.85 + 0.053 Property Rights âˆ’ 1.88 Not Heavy
